#
# Hyperelasticity
# ===============
#
# This demo is implemented in a single Python file,
# :download:`demo_hyperelasticity.py`, which contains both the
# variational forms and the solver.
#
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# See the section :ref:`hyperelasticity` for some mathematical
# background on this demo.
#
#
# Implementation
# --------------
#
# This demo is implemented in the :download:`demo_hyperelasticity.py`
# file.
#
# First, the required modules are imported::

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dolfin import *

# The behavior of the form compiler FFC can be adjusted by prescribing
# various parameters. Here, we want to use the UFLACS backend of FFC::

# Optimization options for the form compiler
parameters["form_compiler"]["cpp_optimize"] = True
parameters["form_compiler"]["representation"] = "uflacs"

# The first line tells the form compiler to use C++ compiler optimizations when
# compiling the generated code. The remainder is a dictionary of options which
# will be passed to the form compiler. It lists the optimizations strategies
# that we wish the form compiler to use when generating code.
#
# .. index:: VectorFunctionSpace
#
# First, we need a tetrahedral mesh of the domain and a function space
# on this mesh. Here, we choose to create a unit cube mesh with 25 ( =
# 24 + 1) vertices in one direction and 17 ( = 16 + 1) vertices in the
# other two direction. On this mesh, we define a function space of
# continuous piecewise linear vector polynomials (a Lagrange vector
# element space)::

# Create mesh and define function space
mesh = UnitCubeMesh(24, 16, 16)
V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "Lagrange", 2)

# Note that :py:class:`VectorFunctionSpace
# <dolfin.functions.functionspace.VectorFunctionSpace>` creates a
# function space of vector fields. The dimension of the vector field
# (the number of components) is assumed to be the same as the spatial
# dimension, unless otherwise specified.
#
# .. index:: compiled subdomain
#
# The portions of the boundary on which Dirichlet boundary conditions
# will be applied are now defined::

# Mark boundary subdomians
left =  CompiledSubDomain("near(x[0], side) && on_boundary", side = 0.0)
right = CompiledSubDomain("near(x[0], side) && on_boundary", side = 1.0)

# The boundary subdomain ``left`` corresponds to the part of the
# boundary on which :math:`x=0` and the boundary subdomain ``right``
# corresponds to the part of the boundary on which :math:`x=1`. Note
# that C++ syntax is used in the :py:func:`CompiledSubDomain`
# <dolfin.compilemodules.subdomains.CompiledSubDomain>` function since
# the function will be automatically compiled into C++ code for
# efficiency. The (built-in) variable ``on_boundary`` is true for points
# on the boundary of a domain, and false otherwise.
#
# .. index:: compiled expression
#
# The Dirichlet boundary values are defined using compiled expressions::

# Define Dirichlet boundary (x = 0 or x = 1)
c = Constant((0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
r = Expression(("scale*0.0",
                "scale*(y0 + (x[1] - y0)*cos(theta) - (x[2] - z0)*sin(theta) - x[1])",
                "scale*(z0 + (x[1] - y0)*sin(theta) + (x[2] - z0)*cos(theta) - x[2])"),
                scale = 0.5, y0 = 0.5, z0 = 0.5, theta = pi/7, degree=2)

# Note the use of setting named parameters in the :py:class:`Expression
# <dolfin.functions.expression.Expression>` for ``r``.
#
# The boundary subdomains and the boundary condition expressions are
# collected together in two :py:class:`DirichletBC
# <dolfin.fem.bcs.DirichletBC>` objects, one for each part of the
# Dirichlet boundary::

bcl = DirichletBC(V, c, left)
bcr = DirichletBC(V, r, right)
bcs = [bcl, bcr]

# The Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions are constraints on the
# function space :math:`V`. The function space is therefore required as
# an argument to :py:class:`DirichletBC <dolfin.fem.bcs.DirichletBC>`.
#
# .. index:: TestFunction, TrialFunction, Constant
#
# Trial and test functions, and the most recent approximate displacement
# ``u`` are defined on the finite element space ``V``, and two objects
# of type :py:class:`Constant <dolfin.functions.constant.Constant>` are
# declared for the body force (``B``) and traction (``T``) terms::

# Define functions
du = TrialFunction(V)            # Incremental displacement
v  = TestFunction(V)             # Test function
u  = Function(V)                 # Displacement from previous iteration
B  = Constant((0.0, -0.5, 0.0))  # Body force per unit volume
T  = Constant((0.1,  0.0, 0.0))  # Traction force on the boundary

# In place of :py:class:`Constant <dolfin.functions.constant.Constant>`,
# it is also possible to use ``as_vector``, e.g.  ``B = as_vector( [0.0,
# -0.5, 0.0] )``. The advantage of Constant is that its values can be
# changed without requiring re-generation and re-compilation of C++
# code. On the other hand, using ``as_vector`` can eliminate some
# function calls during assembly.
#
# With the functions defined, the kinematic quantities involved in the model
# are defined using UFL syntax::

# Kinematics
d = len(u)
I = Identity(d)             # Identity tensor
F = I + grad(u)             # Deformation gradient
C = F.T*F                   # Right Cauchy-Green tensor

# Invariants of deformation tensors
Ic = tr(C)
J  = det(F)

# Next, the material parameters are set and the strain energy density
# and the total potential energy are defined, again using UFL syntax::

# Elasticity parameters
E, nu = 10.0, 0.3
mu, lmbda = Constant(E/(2*(1 + nu))), Constant(E*nu/((1 + nu)*(1 - 2*nu)))

# Stored strain energy density (compressible neo-Hookean model)
psi = (mu/2)*(Ic - 3) - mu*ln(J) + (lmbda/2)*(ln(J))**2

# Total potential energy
Pi = psi*dx - dot(B, u)*dx - dot(T, u)*ds

# Just as for the body force and traction vectors, :py:class:`Constant
# <dolfin.functions.constant.Constant>` has been used for the model
# parameters ``mu`` and ``lmbda`` to avoid re-generation of C++ code
# when changing model parameters. Note that ``lambda`` is a reserved
# keyword in Python, hence the misspelling ``lmbda``.
#
# .. index:: directional derivative; derivative, taking variations; derivative, automatic differentiation; derivative
#
# Directional derivatives are now computed of :math:`\Pi` and :math:`L`
# (see :eq:`first_variation` and :eq:`second_variation`)::

# Compute first variation of Pi (directional derivative about u in the direction of v)
F = derivative(Pi, u, v)

# Compute Jacobian of F
J = derivative(F, u, du)

# The complete variational problem can now be solved by a single call to
# :py:func:`solve <dolfin.fem.solving.solve>`::

# Solve variational problem
solve(F == 0, u, bcs, J=J)

# Finally, the solution ``u`` is saved to a file named
# ``displacement.pvd`` in VTK format, and the deformed mesh is plotted
# to the screen::

# Save solution in VTK format
file = File("displacement.pvd");
file << u;

# Plot solution
plot(u)
plt.show()
